# 🧑‍💻Dawid Kraśnicki
**`Front-end developer`**

I am a developer who builds all projects from scratch starting from UI / UX ending with databases. My main technology is JavaScript / React, but I use technologies such as Firebase or Node.js for my projects. Every day I try to add something from myself to this digital world by creating new projects and solving problems with the code.`
